# getBaseCSS() Refactor — Change Impact Analysis

Purpose
- Capture the technical and product impact of extracting the large `getBaseCSS()` method (currently returning an inlined, large CSS string inside `src/ui/dashboard.ts`) into a separate CSS asset and refactoring the code to load that asset from the extension's `resources` or `dist` bundle.
- Provide a migration plan, tests, roll-out steps, and a checklist of files to update.

Context
- `DashboardManager.getBaseCSS()` contains a large, inlined CSS template used to style the extension dashboard webview. Static analysis shows this method is sizeable and bloats the TypeScript source file and compiled bundle.
- Extracting CSS into an external `.css` file improves readability, reduces compiled TypeScript bundle size, enables editing the stylesheet independently, and allows the webview to be served as a separate resource (improves caching and tooling compatibility such as Tailwind/PostCSS pipeline).

Summary of proposed change
1. Create a new file `src/ui/dashboardStyles.css` (or `resources/webview/dashboard.css`) containing the CSS previously returned by `getBaseCSS()`.
2. Update `DashboardManager.getBaseCSS()` to either:
   - Return a small string that includes a `<link rel="stylesheet" href="${webview.asWebviewUri(localUri)}">` snippet (preferred). OR
   - Load the CSS file contents at runtime (synchronously or asynchronously) and return it as inline CSS (fallback option).
3. Ensure `webview.asWebviewUri()` is used to convert the extension-local `vscode.Uri.file(...)` path into a webview-accessible URI.
4. Update build packaging (esbuild) to include the new CSS in `dist` or the VSIX `resources` so it is available at runtime.

Files likely affected
- src/ui/dashboard.ts (primary) — remove large inline CSS, wire new link or loader
- src/ui/dashboard.css or resources/webview/dashboard.css — new file with extracted CSS
- esbuild.js (build bundling) — ensure CSS is copied into `dist/` or included in VSIX; update watch or copy steps if needed
- package.json — ensure the `files`/packaging step includes the new resource (if using file list or pattern)
- resources/schema/* — probably unaffected, but validate if documentation references inline CSS
- tests: unit/e2e tests touching `DashboardManager` or webview HTML (needs update)
- docs/USER-JOURNEYS-SETUP-REPORT.md — update to reference new asset location (optional)

Behavioral impact
- Visual: No UI change if the external CSS is identical and successfully loaded.
- Load order: The webview must be able to load the stylesheet early enough to avoid FOUC (flash of unstyled content). Using a `<link rel="stylesheet">` in the generated HTML head is best for performance; if inline critical CSS is required, keep a small critical inline subset in `getBaseCSS()` and move the rest to external file.
- Security/CSP: Webviews honour Content Security Policy. Serving a CSS file from `webview.asWebviewUri` is permitted; ensure any style-related inline-style CSP rules are kept consistent. If you rely on `style-src 'unsafe-inline'`, consider removing that if possible.
- Packaging: The new CSS file must be part of the VSIX. The packaging step already includes many resources; verify `esbuild` and `vsce` include the new file.

Risks and mitigations
- Risk: Webview cannot find or load the CSS (404) → results in unstyled or partially styled dashboard.
  - Mitigation: Provide a robust fallback: keep a small critical inline CSS in `getBaseCSS()` to preserve layout if the external load fails; also log an error to the extension host and show a non-blocking notification.
- Risk: CSP blocks the CSS or the webview URI scheme not allowed.
  - Mitigation: Use `webview.asWebviewUri()` to convert local files to webview URIs and confirm CSP header in the generated HTML allows the scheme.
- Risk: Build/packaging pipeline forgets to copy CSS into `dist` or VSIX.
  - Mitigation: Update `esbuild.js` or packaging scripts to copy `src/ui/dashboard.css` -> `dist/webview/` (or `resources/`) and add a smoke test that ensures the file exists in the packaged VSIX.
- Risk: Unit tests that assert exact HTML string returned by the dashboard will break.
  - Mitigation: Update tests to be resilient: assert presence of `<link rel="stylesheet"` with appropriate href or assert that CSS content is loaded rather than exact HTML.

Testing and verification plan
- Unit tests:
  - Update any tests for `DashboardManager` that depended on the old `getBaseCSS()` string to instead assert the link tag or the presence of critical inline CSS.
  - Add a test that `DashboardManager` generates HTML including a `webview.asWebviewUri`-derived link (mock vscode to validate URI conversion).
- Integration/E2E tests:
  - Launch Extension Development Host and open the dashboard. Confirm styles applied and compare computed styles to expected values (spot check key elements such as header color, font-size).
  - Add a test that extracts the packaged VSIX and verifies `dist/webview/dashboard.css` or `resources/webview/dashboard.css` exists.
- Manual smoke tests:
  1. Build and package: `npm run package` (or `npm run compile + node esbuild.js --production`).
  2. Install VSIX locally: `code --install-extension ./health-watch-1.0.4.vsix`.
  3. Open the dashboard; verify no FOUC and that all visual elements match the previous behavior.

Implementation checklist (concrete steps)
1. Extract CSS
   - Create `src/ui/dashboardStyles.css` with the current `getBaseCSS()` contents (strip wrapping <style> if present) or move to `resources/webview/dashboard.css`.
2. Update TypeScript
   - Modify `getBaseCSS()` to return a short snippet like:
     ```ts
     private getBaseCSS(webview: vscode.Webview, extensionUri: vscode.Uri): string {
       const cssPath = vscode.Uri.joinPath(extensionUri, 'resources', 'webview', 'dashboard.css');
       const cssUri = webview.asWebviewUri(cssPath);
       return `<link rel="stylesheet" href="${cssUri}">`;
     }
     ```
   - If `getBaseCSS()` is called in places that lack `webview` or `extensionUri`, change the call sites to pass them or create a new helper `getBaseCSSLink(webview, extensionUri)`.
3. Build pipeline
   - Update `esbuild.js` to copy the CSS file to `dist/webview/` or ensure the `resources` directory includes the CSS (so VSIX contains it). Add a copy step in the build script if necessary.
4. Tests
   - Update unit tests to mock `vscode` webview and ensure the `link` is present.
5. Fallback and logging
   - Keep a small critical inline CSS string inside `getBaseCSS()` (for layout) if required.
   - If external CSS fails to load, log a warning in extension host console and optionally present a non-blocking notification to the user.
6. Packaging
   - Confirm VSIX contains the new CSS. Add a packaging smoke-check test that extracts the VSIX and asserts the file exists.
7. Docs/Changelog
   - Update `README.md` release notes with the refactor and mention that theming edits can now be done in the CSS file directly.

Code examples and considerations
- Using `webview.asWebviewUri` (recommended):

```ts
const cssLocal = vscode.Uri.joinPath(extensionUri, 'resources', 'webview', 'dashboard.css');
const cssUri = webview.asWebviewUri(cssLocal);
const linkTag = `<link rel="stylesheet" href="${cssUri}">`;
```

- If you must inline at build time (e.g., to avoid FOUC), use a small critical subset inline and lazy-load the rest:

```html
<style>/* critical CSS here */</style>
<script>
  const link = document.createElement('link');
  link.rel = 'stylesheet';
  link.href = '...webview URI...';
  document.head.appendChild(link);
</script>
```

Build & test commands
- Local build and pack
```powershell
npm run compile
npm run package
# then verify VSIX exists
ls *.vsix
```

- Run tests
```powershell
npm run compile-tests
npm run test:unit
npm run test:e2e
```

Rollout plan
1. Implement and test locally (branch: `refactor/dashboard-css-extract`).
2. Run unit + e2e tests, resolve regressions.
3. Create PR and run CI (unit + lint + build). Address any style warnings.
4. Merge to `main` and publish patch release (e.g., v1.0.5) — include release notes.
5. Monitor issue tracker for regressions.

Backward compatibility
- No required changes for users; extracted CSS is internal implementation detail.
- Existing runtime behavior is preserved if packaging and webview URIs are correct.

Appendix — quick grep to locate usages to update
- Search for `getBaseCSS()` and references of the `DashboardManager` constructor and webview HTML template generation to identify all call sites that will need `webview` and `extensionUri` availability.

```powershell
# Example search commands to run locally
Select-String -Path src\**\*.ts -Pattern "getBaseCSS\(|getBaseCss\(" -SimpleMatch
```

- For UI testing: check `src/ui/react/**` and ensure changes are reflected in the React views if they import CSS.
