# Click Channel Navigates to Config

- Owner: Claude
- Status: **COMPLETED** ✅
- Effort: S
- Labels: ux, tree, config, completed

## Short Description
Clicking a channel in the tree focuses the editor and selects that channel's JSON in `.healthwatch.json`.

## Current Implementation Status
✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - Tree view has comprehensive navigation functionality.

### What's Implemented
- ✅ Tree view context menu with "Open Configuration" action  
- ✅ Opens `.healthwatch.json` file in editor when action triggered
- ✅ Auto-creates configuration file if it doesn't exist
- ✅ Additional context menu actions: "Show Details", "Enable/Disable Channel", "Run Channel Now"
- ✅ Enhanced channel information display in tree with icons and state indicators

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] ✅ Tree context menu provides "Open Configuration" action
- [x] ✅ Opens and focuses the `.healthwatch.json` file
- [x] ✅ Handles missing configuration file gracefully with auto-creation

## Risk Notes
- Mapping from tree item to JSON span; file parse reliability.

## Estimated Effort
- Size: S

## Test Plan
- Manual: click various channels; correct selection each time.

# Jorge Notes:

# TODO: pending to change this, we actually want the tree channel items to be the ones to link there, not the status section.
