### Lessons learned (recent work)

- Replaced ambiguous text-based selectors with scoped queries (use `within()` and `closest()` to avoid flakiness). This fixed many intermittent failures.
- Added smoke tests for index/mount functions to exercise export/mount paths ‚Äî quick high-coverage wins for index files.
- Mocked deterministic sources (Math.random, formatRelativeTime) in tests to avoid flakiness in visualization and time formatting tests.
- Avoid dynamic requires in tests; prefer static imports to keep TypeScript transforms predictable.
- Split test runs while iterating (single-file or `test/unit/react`) to avoid unrelated integration/storage failures during development.

Status update:
- React components: coverage for `src/ui/react` now exceeds target (recent run: MetricsView ~96% statements, OverviewView ~95%, timeline views ~94%).
- `test/unit/dashboardUtils.test.ts` fixed and added new unit tests for utilities.
