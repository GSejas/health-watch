Task received — I'll recommend libraries and future integrations tailored to Health Watch (local VS Code extension + webviews) and explain tradeoffs and where to apply each.

Plan: short checklist, recommended libs grouped by purpose with one-line rationales, prioritized integrations to add later, and a minimal starter stack you can adopt now.

Checklist
- [x] Libraries for storage, telemetry, metrics, logging, webview/UI, validation, and helpers
- [x] Recommended external integrations (exporters, dashboards, alert destinations)
- [x] Prioritized path: what to add first and why
- [x] Small starter stack (minimal set to implement now)

Libraries (by purpose)

Storage & local DB
- better-sqlite3 — fast, synchronous SQLite bindings; excellent for single-process desktop extensions, simple schema, transactions, indexing. (Good choice for probe attempts and queries.)
- sqlite3 (node-sqlite3) — async SQLite if you prefer async API; slightly more complex.
- Level (level/levelup) — key/value store for append-heavy workloads (if you want performant simple K/V without SQL).
- lowdb — small JSON DB wrapper for prototypes (easy, but not good for high volume).

Why: SQLite gives indexing, queries, and durability without separate infra. better-sqlite3 is popular, easy to use, and fast for single-process extensions.

Metrics, histograms & quantiles
- prom-client — expose Prometheus metrics (counters/gauges/histograms) from the extension or a local collector.
- hdr-histogram-js or tdigest-js — accurate latency histograms and quantile estimation for p50/p95/p99 without storing every sample.

Why: Histograms/quantiles are essential to avoid storing raw samples forever.

Tracing & telemetry
- @opentelemetry/api, @opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node, @opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http — allow exporting traces/telemetry to collectors/backends (OTLP).
- @opentelemetry/sdk-metrics for metric export.

Why: OpenTelemetry is vendor-neutral and makes integrations with backends easy.

Logging
- pino — fast structured logger; supports serializers and transports.
- winston — flexible, many transports (if you need feature-rich logging).

Why: Structured logs make later export and search easier; pino is lightweight and performant.

Alerting / dedup / notifications
- node-schedule or cron-like libs (node-cron) — schedule probe cadence or backoff timers.
- bottleneck — rate-limiting and throttling (useful for suppression and avoiding notification storms).
- use simple in-process rule engine or write small matching logic; for robust rules consider a tiny rule library (json-rules-engine) if you want complex condition evaluation.

Validation & schemas
- zod or io-ts — runtime schema validation for incoming probe payloads, config, and saved files.

Why: Prevent corrupted storage and ensure consistent shape across versions.

Webview / UI helpers
- React / Preact — you already have React bundles; Preact if you want smaller bundle size.
- lit-html or snabbdom — lightweight templating for webviews if not using React.
- sanitize-html or DOMPurify — sanitize any HTML coming from probes or logs before inserting into webview.

Bundling & dev
- esbuild — already used, great minimal bundler.
- rollup / webpack — if you need more complex pipelines (not required now).

Utilities
- lodash — general helpers.
- lru-cache or node-cache — in-memory caches for recent attempts.
- chokidar — watch files for storage changes if you need to react to disk updates.

Tradeoffs summary
- JSON files / lowdb: easiest to implement, lowest ops cost, but poor query/scale. Good for small datasets and prototypes.
- better-sqlite3: best local durability/query and performance for moderate data. Use if you expect many attempts and need queries.
- LevelDB: better throughput for huge append-only workloads; lacks SQL flexibility.

Recommended Integrations (prioritized)

High priority (most immediate value)
1. Prometheus metrics (via prom-client or exposing a push endpoint) — for time-series monitoring and alert rules.
2. OpenTelemetry exporter (OTLP) — let users send telemetry to collectors (Grafana Cloud, Elastic, Datadog via OTLP).
3. Alert destinations: Webhook, Slack, Microsoft Teams, Email — essential notification channels.

Medium priority
4. Grafana dashboards / export — provide a JSON or panel export to let users visualize externally.
5. Loki (logs) or Elastic integration — push structured probe logs for search/retention.
6. Simple PagerDuty or Opsgenie integration for critical notifications.

Lower / optional
7. Jaeger/Tempo exporter (traces) — if you add distributed tracing or multi-stage probes.
8. S3 / Cloud backups for long-term archives.

Why these: Prometheus/OTel + Grafana cover metrics + visualization + alerting; Slack/Webhook/PagerDuty cover notification destinations.

Integration patterns & UX
- Provide both push (webhook/OTLP) and optional file-export (JSON/CSV) modes.
- Let users configure exporters in settings (enable/disable, endpoint, auth).
- Offer “maintenance mode” (global) and per-channel snooze; expose lastNotificationAt and mute windows to UI.
- Allow “export to Grafana” or direct OTLP push for advanced analysis.

Minimal starter stack to implement now (recommended)
- Storage: better-sqlite3 (or sqlite3) for attempts/outages + small JSON for lightweight settings.
- Metrics: hdr-histogram-js for latency rollups; prom-client for local metrics (optional).
- Telemetry export: @opentelemetry/sdk-metrics + OTLP exporter (future toggle).
- Logging: pino.
- Validation: zod.
- UI: keep current React setup for metrics; add small React/vanilla UI to snooze channels and inspect recent attempts.

Concrete quick package list (npm)
- better-sqlite3
- prom-client
- hdr-histogram-js
- @opentelemetry/api @opentelemetry/sdk-metrics @opentelemetry/exporter-collector
- pino
- zod
- node-cron (if needed)
- lru-cache

Suggested phased rollout
1. Add per-channel snooze and cooldown (no external deps required).
2. Replace JSON file attempts with SQLite schema (add better-sqlite3). Migrate existing files.
3. Add histogram rollups (hdr-histogram-js) and use for p50/p95 in UI.
4. Add prom-client to expose metrics (optionally local HTTP or pushgateway).
5. Add OTLP exporter to send to collectors (configurable).
6. Add log export to Loki/Elastic if needed; add PagerDuty/Slack integration for alerts.

Security & privacy notes
- Do not auto-send probe payloads externally by default. Provide opt-in and clear settings.
- Sanitize any HTML/strings shown in the webview (DOMPurify / sanitize-html).
- Secure credentials for webhooks/exporters in `globalState` or `SecretStorage` (VS Code API).

If you want, I can:
- Create a small types.ts addition for `ProbeAttempt` and a SQLite schema file + tiny `storage` helpers to write attempts to SQLite.
- Add `hdr-histogram-js` integration and a simple p95 calculator.
Tell me which quick starter (snooze vs SQLite vs histograms) to implement and I’ll make the changes and run the build/tests.
