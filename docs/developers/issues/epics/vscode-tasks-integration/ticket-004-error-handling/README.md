## ðŸ“‹ Ticket Summary

**Handle edge cases, errors, and failure scenarios for task-based monitoring with comprehensive error recovery, helpful user guidance, and robust multi-window coordination.**

## Summary
Handle edge cases, errors, and failure scenarios for task-based monitoring.

## Error Scenarios

### Task Not Found
- Show helpful error message
- Suggest similar task names
- Guide user to create missing task

### Execution Timeouts
- Kill runaway tasks after timeout
- Create failure sample with timeout reason
- Log timeout events for debugging

### Task Failures
- Handle non-zero exit codes gracefully  
- Capture error output for debugging
- Support retry logic for transient failures

### Multi-window Coordination
- Prevent duplicate task executions
- Handle leader/follower task execution
- Coordinate task results across windows

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Task not found error handling
- [ ] Timeout detection and cleanup
- [ ] Retry logic for failed tasks  
- [ ] Multi-window task coordination
- [ ] Error logging and debugging

**Story Points: 1**
