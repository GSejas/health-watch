The most widely used **observability tools** in 2025 are:

- **Prometheus**: Leading for metrics collection, time-series storage, and alerting via Alertmanager. Integrates with Grafana for visualization[4].
- **Grafana**: Popular for visualization; supports logs (Loki), traces (Tempo), and metrics (Mimir)[1][3].
- **Elastic Observability (ELK Stack)**: Unified solution for **logs, metrics, traces/APM**, and powerful for log search/aggregation[5][4].
- **Dynatrace, Datadog, New Relic**: Full-stack SaaS platforms providing metrics, logs, traces, real-time analytics, and anomaly detection (often powered by AI). These are usually less minimal and more enterprise-focused[1][3][5].
- **OpenTelemetry**: Open, vendor-neutral standard for generating and exporting **metrics, logs, and traces** across the stack[2]. Ideal for wire-format and data model inspiration.

### 2. Common Data Models & Example JSON Schemas

**Telemetry covers:**
- **Metrics**: Numeric time-series (e.g., response time)
- **Logs**: Timestamps + semi-structured messages/events
- **Traces**: Hierarchical, request-level timing (+ spans)
- **Probe Attempts**: Synthetic health checks, storing success/failure per target

Example JSON formats for a lightweight health watch/probe system:

**Probe Attempt**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-19T08:15:00Z",
  "target": "https://api.example.com/health",
  "success": true,
  "duration_ms": 143,
  "status_code": 200,
  "error_message": null
}
```

**Sample (Aggregated Metrics)**
```json
{
  "time_window_start": "2025-08-19T08:10:00Z",
  "window_seconds": 60,
  "target": "https://api.example.com/health",
  "success_count": 10,
  "failure_count": 1,
  "avg_latency_ms": 145,
  "latency_p95_ms": 170
}
```

**Outage**
```json
{
  "target": "https://api.example.com/health",
  "detected_at": "2025-08-19T07:51:00Z",
  "resolved_at": "2025-08-19T07:58:30Z",
  "total_failures": 6,
  "first_error": "Timeout"
}
```

**Alert**
```json
{
  "target": "https://api.example.com/health",
  "alert_type": "OUTAGE",
  "sent_at": "2025-08-19T07:51:30Z",
  "severity": "high",
  "description": "Health check failed for 3 consecutive attempts"
}
```

### 3. Common Observability Flows and Interfaces

Standard flow in modern observability stacks:

**Instrumentation** → **Collector** → **Storage** → **Query/Visualization** → **Alerting**

- *Instrumentation*: inserts probe code or agent (e.g., curl/wget/http client for health checks)
- *Collector*: gathers and batches probe results (often locally embedded)
- *Storage*: writes to disk, DB, or forwards to central backend (e.g., Prometheus, Elasticsearch, SQLite)
- *Query/Visualization*: exposes simple dashboards/charts (Grafana panel, CLI, or simple UI)
- *Alerting*: triggers notifications via rule matching (email, Slack, webhook) when thresholds/events occur[2][3][4].

---

### 4. Typical UX Patterns for Monitoring Tools

- **Active Watch**: Sends probes at intervals; displays real-time/updating status (e.g., green/red bhadge, latency chart).
- **Snooze/Maintenance Mode**: Temporarily suppresses alerts for targets undergoing maintenance (UI toggle or calendar/time-based).
- **Alert Suppression/Deduplication**: Avoid sending duplicate alerts for the same outage; coalesce repeated failures into a single notification or periodic reminder (common in PagerDuty, Datadog).
- **Acknowledge/Resolve Flow**: Users can acknowledge (suppress until recovery/end), resolve (when fixed), and review past alerts/outages in history.

---

### 5. Retention, Sampling, and Aggregation Strategies

High-volume synthetic probes can overwhelm storage and visualization.

- **Windowed aggregation** (minutely, hourly): Store only rollups (success rate, quantiles) for raw probe data beyond 1-7 days.
- **Sampling**: For very frequent or noisy checks, only retain a random/sample subset of probe results over time.
- **Retention**: Keep detailed probe logs short-lived (a few days); store aggregates (e.g., minutely) for weeks/months.
- **Downsampling**: Reduce data granularity as it ages (e.g., raw → 1-min → 5-min → hourly aggregates).

### 6. Storage Options for Local Tools

**Disk JSON Files**
- + Simple, portable, human-readable, easily greppable.
- – Inefficient at high volume, slow for queries over long time ranges, no native indexing.

**SQLite**
- + Transactional, indexed queries, good Python/Go support, easy backup.
- – DB file locking limits write concurrency, but sufficient for single-process probe agents.

**LevelDB/RocksDB**
- + Key-value store optimized for append-heavy workloads, better for very high write rates.
- – No SQL/relational query features, more complexity than most lightweight needs.

*Recommendation*: For a minimal, local health-watch tool, **SQLite** offers the best tradeoff: robust and versatile without requiring external dependencies.

### 7. Minimal Health Watch Implementation (Types, APIs, Storage, UI)

**Core Types:**
- ProbeAttempt
- ProbeTarget
- Alert
- Outage (optional)
- AggregateSample

**Key APIs:**
- `POST /probe-result` (input probe outcome)
- `GET /status` (fetch current/most recent health by target)
- `GET /history?target=X` (list/histogram of recent outcomes)
- `POST /snooze` and `/unsnooze` (per-target or global maintenance mode)
- `GET /alerts` (current, unacknowledged alerts)

**Storage Layout (SQLite, practical):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE probe_attempts (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  timestamp DATETIME,
  target TEXT,
  success BOOLEAN,
  duration_ms INTEGER,
  status_code INTEGER,
  error_message TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE alerts (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  target TEXT,
  raised_at DATETIME,
  resolved_at DATETIME,
  description TEXT,
  acked BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);

CREATE TABLE snoozes (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  target TEXT,
  start DATETIME,
  end DATETIME
);
```

**Core UI Controls:**
- **Watchlist:** List of monitored targets, status badge (green/yellow/red), toggle for active/inactive
- **History:** Chart of probe results over time per target (latency, error rate)
- **Snooze toggle:** Temporarily mute alerts (per target, per duration)
- **Alert panel:** Shows unacknowledged/outstanding alerts
- **Settings:** Probe interval, retention, alert threshold config
