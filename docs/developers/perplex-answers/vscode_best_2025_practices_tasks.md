## Output

The current best practices in 2025 for developing VS Code extensions that programmatically execute and monitor tasks using the **VS Code Tasks API** center around reliable discovery, robust lifecycle management, accurate output parsing, and resilient error handling. Several recent API changes and patterns, particularly around problem matchers and shell/terminal integration, are now standard.

**Task Discovery Patterns**
- **Programmatic Discovery:** Use the stable `vscode.tasks.fetchTasks()` API to retrieve all available tasks and filter by their properties (e.g., task type, name, group) as needed for your extension’s context. This continues to be the production-ready approach for discovering built-in and user-defined tasks.
- **Contextual Scanning:** Many widely used extensions cache results from `fetchTasks()` on activation and watch for `onDidChangeTasks` to refresh the cache, minimizing unnecessary API calls and keeping the extension's perceived performance high.

**Execution Lifecycle Management**
- **Starting Tasks:** Use `vscode.tasks.executeTask(task)` to programmatically start a specific task instance.
- **Monitoring:** Listen for task lifecycle events with `vscode.tasks.onDidStartTask`, `onDidEndTask`, `onDidStartTaskProcess`, and `onDidEndTaskProcess`. Extensions often correlate these events with a unique task identifier or user data for precise tracking.
- **Handling Background Tasks:** Extensions commonly check for `isBackground` on tasks and toggle UI indicators to avoid premature completion signals for long-running processes[1].

**Result Parsing from Task Outputs**
- **Problem Matchers:** Leverage or extend VS Code’s robust **problem matcher** system in `tasks.json` for automatic output parsing. Modifying problem matchers—such as overriding `applyTo` or `severity`—ensures errors and warnings from task outputs are surfaced accurately in the Problems panel[1].
- **New API (2025):** A new *proposed* API, `taskProblemMatcherStatus`, lets extensions monitor exactly when problem matcher parsing starts and finishes for granular tracking of diagnostics—this is especially useful for custom error flows and UI updates[2].
- **Terminal Output:** For advanced scenarios, some extensions implement their own terminal parsers by capturing and analyzing output from the task’s associated terminal, though this is less robust than using problem matchers.

**Error Handling for Missing/Failed Tasks**
- **Missing Tasks:** Proper patterns include catching errors from `fetchTasks()` or filtering results and showing non-blocking warnings or notifications if required tasks are missing, commonly with actionable “Configure Task” links.
- **Failed Tasks:** Extensions track `onDidEndTaskProcess` and inspect the `exitCode`. A non-zero exit triggers a standardized error notification and often prompts the user with links to logs or documentation for further troubleshooting.
- **Telemetry:** Production extensions log missing/failed task events for telemetry, improving extension reliability and support.

**Recent API Changes and Deprecations**
- **2025 Updates:** The March 2025 release introduces the *proposed* `taskProblemMatcherStatus` API—it is opt-in and not yet stable, but recommended for extensions requiring fine-grained lifecycle monitoring of problem matcher parsing[2].
- **Terminal.shellIntegration:** Improvements in how `TerminalShellIntegration.executeCommand` tracks sub-executions and command completions make terminal output analysis more reliable for tasks launched via shells, but this is relevant only if deep shell introspection is required[2].
- **General Stability:** No major deprecations, but extensions are encouraged to avoid relying on internal/unstable APIs (like manipulating tasks through the tasks.json file programmatically).

**Patterns from Popular Extensions**
- **Caching, event-driven management:** Extensions like ESLint and Thunder Client cache task configurations and update state via event listeners, combining low overhead with real-time updates[4].
- **User-centric error recovery:** Popular tools display concise, actionable feedback upon failure, avoiding cryptic error stacks and focusing on helping users recover quickly.
- **Advocating Official Matchers:** Most mature extensions rely on official or extends problem matchers to keep output parsing robust through editor updates[1].

**Summary of Key Practices:**
- Use `fetchTasks()` and event listeners for robust discovery and lifecycle management.
- Rely on and extend problem matchers for output parsing.
- Adopt the new `taskProblemMatcherStatus` API for precise monitoring if needed[2].
- Handle missing/failed scenarios gracefully and log/tailor errors for actionable user feedback.
- Keep abreast of proposed APIs, but prefer stable ones for core workflows unless you are targeting the VS Code Insiders user base.

These practices reflect the standards used in respected contemporary extensions, incorporating both stable workflows and the latest API proposals for forward compatibility[1][2][4].
