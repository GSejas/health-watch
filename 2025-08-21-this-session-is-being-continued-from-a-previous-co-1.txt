> what is the actual solve you proposed, before this semantics file, for the concept issues? do we have 
  that documented, where we document actual code changes to account for the conflation and just complexity
   of current features

● Looking at the tracking documentation I created, the actual code changes I proposed for the concept
  issues were:

● Read(docs\tracking\conceptual-issues-tracking.csv)
  ⎿  Read 13 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(docs\tracking\implementation-priority-proposal.csv)
  ⎿  Read 16 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● The actual code solutions I proposed for the concept issues were:

  CRITICAL-2: Watch vs Monitoring Terminology (Currently In Progress)

  Code Changes:
  - API Methods: Rename startWatch() → beginActiveMonitoring(), stopWatch() → returnToBaseline()
  - UI Strings: "Start Watch" → "Monitor Closely", "Watch Mode" → "Active Monitoring"
  - Status Bar: "Watch: Active" → "Active Monitoring"
  - Semantic Mapping: Created src/terminology/semanticMapping.ts with complete terminology transformation

  HIGH-4: Individual Channel Watch

  Code Changes:
  - New API Methods: watchChannel(channelId, duration), stopWatchingChannel(channelId)
  - Enhanced Channel Cards: Add individual "Monitor Closely" buttons per channel
  - WatchManager: Support per-channel watch sessions instead of just global
  - Scheduler Logic: Apply intensive intervals to specific channels only

  HIGH-5: Configuration Precedence Simplification

  Code Changes:
  - Clear Hierarchy: channel.intervalSec > watch.highCadence > defaults.intervalSec
  - UI Indicators: Show "why this interval" explanations in tooltips
  - ConfigManager Refactor: Single getEffectiveInterval(channelId) method that shows precedence reasoning

  MEDIUM-3: Monitoring Mode Mental Model

  Code Changes:
  - MonitoringMode Enum: baseline | intensive | crisis | paused
  - State Indicators: Visual mode indicators in UI showing current monitoring intensity
  - Mode Descriptions: Clear explanations of what each mode means and when it's used

  The semanticMapping.ts file I created is the implementation foundation for fixing the terminology
  confusion - it provides the mapping between old confusing terms and new clear ones. The next step is
  applying this mapping across the actual UI components, which is what I was in the process of
  implementing when you asked this question.
