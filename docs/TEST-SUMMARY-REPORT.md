TEST SUMMARY REPORT

Scope
- Repository: Health Watch (local VS Code extension)
- Focus: React component unit tests under `src/ui/react` and supporting pure helpers in `src/ui/dashboardUtils.ts`.

What I changed
- Added focused unit tests for `MetricsView` and pure helper utilities.
- Stabilized existing React tests by replacing ambiguous DOM queries with scoped queries and by mocking nondeterministic sources (Math.random, formatRelativeTime).
- Fixed transform/test errors caused by stray Mocha-style code blocks in new test files.
- Ran a React-only test suite and produced a v8 coverage snapshot for `src/ui/react`.

Coverage snapshot (recent run)
- src/ui/react/metrics/MetricsView.tsx: ~96% statements
- src/ui/react/metrics/index.tsx: ~92% statements
- src/ui/react/overview/OverviewView.tsx: ~95% statements
- src/ui/react/timeline/*: ~93-95% statements
- src/ui/react/monitor/LiveMonitorView.tsx: ~84% statements
- Note: repository-wide coverage remains low because many core modules (storage, probes, runner) are untested by design in this phase.

Key lessons learned
- Always use accessible and scoped queries (`getByRole`, `within`, closest selectors) to avoid ambiguous matches.
- Make UI tests deterministic: mock Math.random, freeze time or spy on formatting helpers when asserting formatted outputs.
- Keep UI tests isolated from storage/probes/core tests in CI; run them in separate jobs to avoid environmental and mocking conflicts.
- Small smoke tests that mount/unmount components and call exported helpers are quick coverage wins for index files.

Immediate next steps (recommended)
1. Add remaining timeline tests: `TimelineHeatmapView`, `TimelineSwimlanesView`, `TimelineIncidentsView` to reach feature parity and increase coverage on timeline components.
2. Create a React-only CI job that runs `vitest` for `test/unit/react` with coverage and uploads `lcov`/artifact for PR checks. Keep core tests separate.
3. Triage failing non-UI tests (storage, probes, MySQL mocks): isolate and fix mocks or port Mocha-specific constructs to Vitest. These are larger effort and should be scheduled separately.
4. Add `test/ci/collect-coverage.sh` or CI steps to produce `lcov` and HTML reports for PRs (use `--coverage` flags and the desired reporter).

Suggested owners
- React tests & UI: frontend lead / whoever owns `src/ui/react` (quick wins and small PRs)
- Storage & Core tests: backend/infra engineer familiar with storage mocking and MySQL test harness

Verification performed
- Ran `vitest` on `test/unit/react` and observed all tests passing locally.
- Ran dashboard utils tests added and validated passing behavior.

Files added/updated

- test/TEST-AUTOMATION-PLAN.md (updated: lessons learned + status)

Contact
- For follow-ups, specify which CI runner will host the React-only job and whether lcov reporter is required (the local project had an initial lcov reporter issue; v8 works correctly).
