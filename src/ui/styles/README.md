# Health Watch CSS Architecture

## Overview

The Health Watch dashboard CSS has been refactored from a monolithic inline CSS approach to a modular, component-based architecture. This improves maintainability, readability, and follows proper separation of concerns.

## Architecture

### Modular Structure

```
src/ui/styles/
├── index.ts              # Main entry point, assembles all modules
├── components/
│   ├── base.ts          # Foundation styles, utilities, animations
│   ├── navigation.ts    # Header, navigation, controls
│   ├── overview.ts      # Metrics cards, banners, empty states
│   ├── channels.ts      # Channel cards, status displays, actions
│   ├── timeline.ts      # Timeline views (swimlanes, heatmap, incidents)
│   └── monitor.ts       # Live monitoring interface
└── dashboardStyles.ts.deprecated  # Original monolithic file (archived)
```

### Security Compliance

All CSS modules maintain strict security compliance:
- **CSP Compliant**: Uses only VS Code theme variables (`var(--vscode-*)`)
- **No External Resources**: No external fonts, CDNs, or imports
- **Risk R15 Mitigation**: Avoids the Tailwind CSS failure pattern

### Usage

```typescript
import { DASHBOARD_CSS } from './styles/index';

// Individual modules can also be imported selectively:
import { BASE_CSS, NAVIGATION_CSS } from './styles/index';
```

## Component Breakdown

### Base (`base.ts`)
- Body/HTML foundation styling
- Utility classes (colors, states, helpers)
- CSS animations and keyframes
- Status indicators and color schemes

### Navigation (`navigation.ts`)
- Dashboard header and title
- Primary and secondary navigation
- Live monitor controls and buttons
- Tab and button styling

### Overview (`overview.ts`)
- Dashboard content layout
- Metrics summary cards
- Watch status banners
- Empty states and placeholders

### Channels (`channels.ts`)
- Channel status cards and grids
- Channel details and information
- Action buttons and controls
- Error states and live monitoring cards

### Timeline (`timeline.ts`)
- Timeline container layouts
- Swimlanes view styling
- Heatmap grid and cells
- Incidents list and cards
- Timeline controls and legends

### Monitor (`monitor.ts`)
- Live monitoring interface
- Real-time activity feeds
- Pulse animations and indicators
- Activity logs and no-activity states

## Migration Notes

1. **Backwards Compatible**: The `DASHBOARD_CSS` export maintains exact compatibility with the original inline CSS
2. **Import Update**: Dashboard.ts now imports from `./styles/index` instead of `./styles/dashboardStyles`
3. **Compilation**: All existing build processes continue to work unchanged
4. **Visual Regression**: User confirmed no visual changes in debug session

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Each component's styles are isolated and focused
2. **Readability**: Clear separation of concerns and logical organization
3. **Reusability**: Individual modules can be imported selectively if needed
4. **Documentation**: Each module has clear JSDoc explaining its purpose
5. **Security**: Maintains CSP compliance and security best practices

## Future Enhancements

- CSS bundling integration (already partially implemented)
- TypeScript interfaces for CSS structure types
- CSS-in-JS conversion for React components
- Further modularization within individual component files
