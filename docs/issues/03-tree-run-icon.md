## Short Description
Replace the context menu text action with a running icon button in the Channels tree.

## âœ… Implementation Completed
**Enhanced in**: `src/ui/treeView.ts`

**Solution**:

- Added spinning sync icon (`sync~spin`) for running channels  
- Improved state-based icons with proper VS Code theme colors
- Enhanced descriptions with emojis and formatted status indicators
- Added comprehensive context menus with new actions

**Key Changes**:
```typescript
// Enhanced icons with better visual feedback
if (this.channelInfo.isRunning) {
    return new vscode.ThemeIcon('sync~spin', new vscode.ThemeColor('progressBar.background'));
}

// Enhanced descriptions with rich formatting
const stateEmoji = this.channelInfo.state === 'online' ? 'ðŸŸ¢' :
                 this.channelInfo.state === 'offline' ? 'ðŸ”´' : 'ðŸŸ¡';
parts.push(`${stateEmoji} ${this.channelInfo.state.toUpperCase()}`);
```
